# Expo Constants.appOwnership Inconsistencies

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Constants.appOwnership` API.  The property sometimes returns `null`, even when the app should clearly indicate ownership. This inconsistency can cause unexpected issues in applications relying on this property for conditional logic.

## Bug Description
The `Constants.appOwnership` property, intended to identify if the app is owned by the current user, inconsistently returns `null`. This occurs across different devices and even within different development environments.  This erratic behavior leads to unpredictable application behavior and makes it difficult to build reliable features that depend on app ownership status. 

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file provides a minimal reproducible example showing how `Constants.appOwnership` can return `null` unexpectedly. 

## Proposed Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a possible workaround using a fallback mechanism in conjunction with other Expo APIs (if available) to determine ownership, although this is not a perfect solution, since it relies on additional APIs that also may have problems.  A proper fix requires a resolution from the Expo team to address the underlying inconsistencies in `Constants.appOwnership`.
