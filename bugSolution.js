The best solution is to report this to the Expo team, as it is a bug in their API.

A potential, but imperfect, workaround is to add error handling and fallback logic.  If `Constants.appOwnership` returns `null`, you could use other methods to infer ownership (though this is not guaranteed to be reliable).  This is highly dependent on your app's functionality and may require creative workarounds. This is NOT a perfect solution, but just a potential mitigation strategy:

```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const appOwnership = Constants.appOwnership;

  let ownershipStatus;
  if (appOwnership === null) {
    // Attempt to determine ownership through alternative methods
    // Example (replace with your app's specific logic): 
    // Check if a user is logged in (or similar indication of ownership)
    const isLoggedIn = checkIfUserIsLoggedIn();
    ownershipStatus = isLoggedIn ? "owned" : "unknown";
  } else {
    ownershipStatus = appOwnership;
  }

  // ... use ownershipStatus in your component
}
```
Remember to replace `checkIfUserIsLoggedIn()` with your application's mechanism for determining user login status or an equivalent indicator of app ownership.
